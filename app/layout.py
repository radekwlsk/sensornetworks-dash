collect environment data over extended periods of time the **wireless sensor networks** are very limited in resources. 
Main characteristics of such networks are:

  - power consumption constraint (battery supplied, passive energy harvesting),
  - nodes failures resilience (must operate even when fraction of nodes fail),
  - limited computational power (strong, hard cryptography protocols are not available),
  - limited memory (can not store or process lot of big variables),
  - unattended operation without network infrastructure (all nodes are the same and have to establish connection on 
their own once deployed in random places over the area).

Given those limitations it is still critical to provide security of processed and transmitted data. As authentication 
protocols used in large networks (like WiFi, LTE) are based on hard computational problems they are not suitable for 
wireless sensor networks.

Easiest way to encrypt and authenticate the communication between the nodes of such network is to store single shared 
private key. But such approach compromises entire network on breach of single node's secret. To tackle this problem 
various protocols were proposed, one of them being *A Key-Management Scheme for Distributed Sensor Networks* proposed 
by **Laurent Eschenauer** and **Virgil D. Gligor** that allows increased security without sacrificing a lot of memory 
and requiring little computational power."""

a 3-step approach can be used for key distribution:

  1. Key pre-distribution:
    - key pool *P* generation,
    - random drawing of *k* keys out of *P* without replacement at random for each node,
    - loading of the selected keys to each node's memory.
  2. Shared-key discovery:
    - after nodes deployment,
    - each node broadcasts its keys to find all nodes in range that it shares at least one key with creating *link*,
    - network topology is established after that step.
  3. Path-key establishment:
    - assigns *path-key* to node pairs that do not share a key but are connected by two or more links after shared-key

Each parameter changes the network's security and topology, the goal is to provide best key protection, lowest 
requirements with highest total network coverage. 

To see how change of each parameter affects the coverage one can use provided plots generators in

A network topology using such key distribution protocol can be simulated in [**Network Graph** section](#network)."""]),
